Deployment:

- Using special MSBuild files taken from http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BINDeployingASPNETMVC3WithRazorToAWindowsServerWithoutMVCInstalled.aspx
 to ease deployment and publishing. This simplifies bin deployment as it copies over all the files needed for the app and MVC to the FTP server.
